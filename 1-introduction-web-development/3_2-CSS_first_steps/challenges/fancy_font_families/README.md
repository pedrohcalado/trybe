Change the font families
This webpage displays the theme songs from a few famous TV families. Each of the lyrics paragraphs have id's, but the CSS rules for them have no properties yet. Add a font-family property to each of the CSS rules, using a generic family name that works for all computers. Choose a different font family for each rule.

Here's a list of generic font families: sans-serif, serif, fantasy, monospace, and cursive.
