Add spans
This webpage describes groupers, a type of large ocean fish. In the first step, your job is to to make the first sentences of each paragraph stand out. Start by adding <span> tags around each first sentence. Then give both of your <span> tags a class called "first-sentence".

Style Spans
Good! Now, using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your "first-sentence" class. Make the sentence either bold, or underlined.

Add a div
Great! Wrap the paragraphs in a single <div>, and then give the div a class of "info".

Style the Div
Last step! Using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your 'info' class. Give it a cool looking background color.
