Resize the div
This webpage describes the ocean, with an image and a few paragraphs which are inside a <div>.
In this first step, style the <div> that has a class of 'info', so that it takes up 70% of the width and is 200px tall.

Make it scroll
Now, make it so the div cuts off the overflowing text and presents a scrollbar instead.

Resize the img
In this last step, write a CSS rule for the ‘pic’ class that resizes the image to take up the same width as the text.
